          <h1>DTMS-micro Tinnitus Therapy System</h1>
          <h2>Clinically proven two-to-one superiority
over conventional tinnitus therapy sounds</h2>
          <p>The Audio  Bionics DTMS-1 (Dynamic Tinnitus Mitigation System) is based on innovative DTM  sound formats shown to be twice as effective as conventional tinnitus  therapy sounds in a first-of-its-kind clinical study sponsored by the Veterans  Administration. The impressive results of the study were published in the  Journal of the American Academy of  Audiology.</p>
          <p>The DTMS-micro is a  comprehensive tinnitus therapy system including a proprietary MP-4 player  providing 12 tracks of improved DTM sound formats, plus two playback devices –  occluding earbuds that reduce external sounds, and an ultra-high performance  desktop speaker. DTMS-micro is exceptionally affordable compared to other treatment  systems, yet provides tinnitus therapy sounds with clinically-proven two-to-one  superiority. </p>
